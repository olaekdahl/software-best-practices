# Example Project Overview

This is a seed overview document for a tiny example project called `Widgetizer`. You can feed this into an LLM to generate a more complete README or documentation site.

## Problem statement

Teams often need a compact example repository to test documentation workflows. `Widgetizer` provides a micro-API and a few seeds to demonstrate end-to-end doc generation.

## Audience

- Engineers evaluating AI-assisted doc generation
- Writers prototyping styles and checks

## Key components

- `src/widgetizer`: a tiny Python module with types and docstrings
- `examples/usage.py`: runnable usage snippet
- `prompts/`: prompt templates for common documentation tasks

## Non-goals

- Production readiness
- Comprehensive functionality
